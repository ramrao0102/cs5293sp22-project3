RamRao	training	Sadako	In Jôji Iida  "Rasen", ██████ explained that the reason behind her curse towards unfortunates was for others to experience pure fear, the same kind of fear she went through all alone at the bottom of a darkened well.
RamRao	training	Sadako	   In Norio Tsuruta  "Bâsudei", the "██████" series continues, except this time we follow a young woman, named ██████(Yukie Nakama), haunted by a ghoulish alter ego with considerable power.
RamRao	training	Hiroshi Tôyama	A sound effects engineer, ██████████████(Seiichi Tanabe), seems to be the only one who accepts her without contention, actually encouraging once she receives the leading role after the actress dies under suspicious, and very unusual, circumstances.
RamRao	training	Sadako	The troupe and crew soon come to the understanding, thanks to a news reporter who instigates a lynch mob after the director(..who initiates a traumatic situation, accusing ██████, an actress he put in position to become a star, of killing the lead actress)is found murdered, his body discovered by a stage hand, that they are accursed(..her photographer  snapshots reveal their distorted faces and other disturbing images).
RamRao	training	Sadako	   A different approach to the "Ringu" series this time making ██████ a sympathetic figure, a young woman tormented by others when, in fact, she is as much a victim as those whose lives are harmed by the vengeful ghoul.
RamRao	training	Sadako	The ghoul is, in a sense, ██████  "protector", a kind of spectre that haunts the theater, and we see how the troupe and crew always respond to our heroine with disdain and disregard.
RamRao	training	Sadako	Tôyama becomes her sole friend and confident and their blossoming romance is the heart and soul of "Ringu 0-Birthday", as he attempts to rescue her from all those that find ██████ a threat..to no avail.
RamRao	training	Sadako	"Bâsudei" actually has two major climaxes, the theatrical production which spirals out of control when it should've been ██████  finest hour on stage, and the discovery of where Ikuma had been hiding the alter ego, the lynch mob, behind an attack on our heroine, coming in contact, face-to-face with a fate worse than death.
RamRao	training	Ikuma	Potent finale, reiterating what I mentioned in the opening sentence of my user comment, as we witness █████  decision to "end all of it" in regards to Sadako.
RamRao	training	Nolte	All logic is thrown into the wind, and the viewer  intelligence is insulted and pounded upon repeatedly with more force than that baseball bat could ever have generated - the one used by █████ and McGregor.
RamRao	training	Nolte	█████ was molesting corpses decades earlier and the writers of this film would have us believe that this man could years later become the city  chief police investigator
RamRao	training	Thomas Edison	Making him the killer is as absurd as giving █████████████ credit for inventing the wheel, as laughable as a conspiracy-theory plot from the "X-Files", and as stupid as Kim Basinger  book on how to solve all of world  problems (if she'd ever write one).
RamRao	training	Nolte	This is an essential piece of the puzzle that is badly missing here; McGregor JUST HAPPENS to get a job where he meets █████.
RamRao	training	Brolin	And McGregor  best friend, ██████, JUST HAPPENS to know a prostitute who is Nolte  play toy (and later victim).
RamRao	training	Brolin	And to add some silliness, ██████ is some kind of a deranged thrill-seeker who acts like a total lunatic all the time.
RamRao	training	Brolin	And how the hell did ██████ get into the mortuary when he carried out his "practical joke"?
RamRao	training	Nolte	And how the hell did █████ manage to drag out a body of one of his victims within seconds of McGregor entering the room, without McGregor noticing it (the fact that he had his walkman on and/or was singing and/or talking doesn't make it any more believable)?
RamRao	training	Arquette	And what  with this annoying scene where ████████ JUST HAPPENS to walk into the mortuary at exactly the moment when McGregor is hitting Nolte with a baseball bat and predictably starts thinking her boyfriend is the killer??
RamRao	training	Brolin	More annoyances came from the scene in which ██████  reaction to McGregor  telling him that the latter is been suspected of murder is to laugh
RamRao	training	Sadako	 This movie focuses on how ██████ becomes the murdering spirit.
RamRao	training	Sadako	This sort of ruins the image of the evil ██████ spirit we know from the other Ringu movies.
RamRao	training	Hannibal Rising	In that regard this movie suffers from the same problem as "███████████████".
RamRao	training	Sadako	For instance I never saw ██████ as a young adult but more as a 12 year old child or so.
RamRao	training	Carrie	You can see this movie as "Ringu" meets "██████", since this movie story- and character-wise definitely show some similarities to the Brian De Palma horror classic "██████", from 1976.
RamRao	training	Sadako	The film fleshes out the back story of the Ring trilogies' demon / troubled soul, ██████, (played by Yukie Nakama), following her attempts to join an acting troupe and at the same time cope with her troubled psyche and the events of her mysterious past that still engulf her.
RamRao	training	Reagan	 The film itself has a fundamentally creepy atmosphere throughout but as with many prequels never really equals the original story, in this case never really delivering the same level of suspense, (although it does come close a couple of times), and failing to shock in the way the original did with Sadako being a silent ██████, (The Exorcist), type character staring at you hatefully through a horrifically blood shot eye, peering through a nest of slimy, sinister, long black hair.
RamRao	training	Sadako	This sees a lot of the scenes shot inside a theatre, which provides a suitably eerie backdrop for ██████  doomed quest to lead a normal life and battle the demons of her past that lurk ever closer.
RamRao	training	Sadako	 With regards to filling in the blanks left open in Ring and Ring 2, this film does very little, for we are already aware that ██████ was pushed to the bottom of the well by her step father, and only hints at the source of the true evil lurking inside her, without giving a clue of its origin or past.
RamRao	training	Seiichi Tanabe	 The actors do a reasonably good job throughout, with a special hats off to ██████████████ who conveyed the confused yet blindly in love hero Tôyama.
RamRao	training	Nakama	██████ brought a certain level of pity to the role of Sadako, a girl seemingly running away from the evil that surrounds and trying to do the right thing.
RamRao	training	Graham Norton	Ireland may have given the world hurling, green beer, █████████████, and that funny dancing where the arms don't move, but it isn't exactly renowned for its horror movies.
RamRao	training	Paddy Breathnach	Shrooms, a psychological chiller from director ████████████████, is unlikely to change that fact.
RamRao	training	Breathnach	 Rather than tell a straightforward scary story, ██████████ unwisely chooses to blur the line between what is reality and what is merely a figment of a drug-addled mind.
RamRao	training	Boyd	The chemistry between ████ and Wolheim worked and the film managed to be quite entertaining.
RamRao	training	Harold Lloyd	Oddly, however, the film managed to beat out ████████████  film, SPEEDY, for an Oscar for Best Direction for a Comedy (a category no longer used)--as SPEEDY was a superior film in most ways (it  one of Lloyd  best films).
RamRao	training	Louis Walheim	 By the way, director Milestone and █████████████ would team up just a few years later for another WWI picture, the great ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT--a film that is definitely NOT a comedy.
RamRao	training	Simon Cowell	Created by ████████████ of American Idol fame, AGT is a talent search show which is similar in format to American Idol and the Gong Show.
RamRao	training	Mr. Koji	Since this movie is an adaptation of ████████ Suzuki  Lemonheart which is among the 3 stories contained in Ringu 0: Baasudei that was released in 1999, it  sufficient say that the director did pretty well with altering some of its contents to suit the interpretation of the previous movies (Ringu and Ringu 2) which was also unparalleled.
RamRao	training	Sadako	I don't think the storyline was confusing at all since it mostly concentrated on ██████  life (Derived from Lemonheart) and doesn't really focus on the curse of the video tape.
RamRao	training	Sadako	 What I truly love about this movie is the fact that they wanted us to feel sympathetic towards ██████  character albeit the wickedness of what we see in Ringu and Ringu 2.
RamRao	training	Yukie Nakama	Bravo to ████████████ for portraying Sadako  character effectively.
RamRao	training	Sadako	It  designed to tell us the tragic story of ██████  life before the cursed video tape, which exceeded from my own expectations.
RamRao	training	Nakata Hideo	 I can see why many are baffled by the story since the one who directed this is not ████████████ and obviously lingered a bit from the previous adaptations (I guess you might say more on the book than Ringu and Ringu 2.).
RamRao	training	Katharine	He meets a female fighter, █████████, who appears to be homeless but who can fight and defeat men twice her size.
RamRao	training	Dublin	The two eventually team up, but ██████  somewhat sleazy past catches up with them, causing conflict, pain, and emotional distress for both.
RamRao	training	Nick Nolte	 Perhaps ██████████  worst role EVER.
RamRao	training	Josh Brolin	Ewan McGregor just looks embarrassed, as do ███████████ and Patricia Arquette.
RamRao	training	Simon	█████ Cowell manages to try another spin-off of "American Idol", despite of the failure with his previous attempt "American Inventor".
RamRao	training	Cowell	Even more, giving it is an open talent contest, half of them are singers what gives ██████ a chance for a shot closer to the "Idol" success.
RamRao	training	Philbin	 Regis ███████ does his job, he always manages to look as a nice guy, I don't think he contributes rising the show interest but is not responsible for the poor overcome either.
RamRao	validation	David Hasselhoff	 Let me start by ████████████████ just because he is the only I know.
RamRao	validation	Piers Morgan	 ████████████, who I don't have any clue who he is, takes the role of the wise and balanced judge completing his stereotype with a British accent that in America seems -wrongfully- to be synonymous of a higher intellect.
RamRao	validation	Brandy	 Finally ██████.
RamRao	validation	Hasselhoff	When ██████████ and Morgan are somehow appealing, Brandy is some kind of hyper-kinetic and overexcited Tasmanian Devil sat in the middle.
RamRao	validation	Brandy	At some point I felt bad for Morgan whose face seems ██████ preferred target for the uncontrollable spin of her arms and her annoying affection demonstrations.
RamRao	validation	Cowell	 In his modesty ██████ doesn't realize that the success of his shows is linked to him being in front the cameras rather than behind them.
RamRao	validation	Simon	If █████ were in this show not even the contestants would be necessary to nail its success.
RamRao	validation	Young Sadako	████████████ is part of a theater troupe, and a reporter knows who she is but the rest of the cast doesn't, at least, not yet.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	There are glimpses of ██████  strange powers, which she can't seem to control when she  threatened.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	██████ then ends up with the leading role in the play but when the meddling reporter slips a tape in that isn't meant to be part of the play, it changes everything and ██████  telekinetic powers are unleashed on the unsuspecting audience and cast, but stopped just short of harm to anyone....except, herself.
RamRao	validation	Ringu	 Just a warning though; it is slow paced, even more so than █████, a complaint many people seem to have with these movies, and the first time i watched it i wasn't sure if it was leading anywhere.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	██████ Yamamura is part of an acting school, and her first role is a few days away.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	The story also follows a journalist who has traced down ██████, she is the widow of a man who died, also under mysterious circumstances at the hands of, she believes, ██████  estranged mother.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	██████  mother was famed for her supposed supernatural abilities, and killed herself a short while ago.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	The journalist wants to find out the truth, and finds ██████ just before opening night.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	Paying one of the jealous girls to mess with the audio equipment, hoping to get a reaction from ██████, much like Hamlet, the play begins to go wrong, and in a Carrie-like scene, everyone blames ██████.
RamRao	validation	Yukie Nakama	The acting has been very good from everyone, especially ████████████, who is gorgeous, and drags out our sympathy.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	Toyama is the only person who trusts ██████, and tries to defend her, eventually leading to one of the most tragic scenes in movie history.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	Every scene is shot trying to balance beauty with the creation of fear, a wonderful irony considering ██████  own birth and life- She doesn't want to hurt anyone, and is capable of great beauty, but all she seems to do is scare and kill.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	 I've probably hyped the film too much now, but the final scenes in the forest and ██████  old home are really that good.
RamRao	validation	Sadako	The point is, the questions are there to be asked, for us to work them out ourselves- we become like the journalists in each of the movies, drawing ourselves closer into the tragedy and threat of ██████  life until we cannot escape.
RamRao	validation	Mr. Knotts	After his stagecoach is held up, ██████████ joins a wagon train.
RamRao	validation	Barbara Rhoades	He plays horsey with buxom ███████████████ (as Penelope Cushings) and dresses up as a fetching Indian squaw.
RamRao	validation	Knotts	Is ██████' character bisexual?
RamRao	validation	Vic Mizzy	█████████  wild, wild western music resembles his own "Green Acres".
RamRao	validation	Bob Hope	All in all, this is a tedious, uncalled for re-make of ████████  "The Paleface" (1948).
RamRao	validation	Sadako Yamamura	 Where ███████████████ is early in her college experience, and dealing with the typical issues of trying to succeed in her love for theater, and her romantic life.
RamRao	validation	Howard Hughes	Was this an early variation of beefcake courtesy of █████████████?
RamRao	validation	Nestor Almendros	Was the DP trying to emulate the work of ████████████████ on DAYS OF HEAVEN by shooting only ambient lighting?
RamRao	validation	Sadako Yamamura	And in "Ringu 0" (2000), the prequel to the original, we get to see the face of ███████████████, heretofore mostly hidden behind long, stringy hair, and, as played by actress Yukie Nakama, it is quite a lovely face indeed.
RamRao	testing	Sadako	We also get to discover some of ██████  back story, and learn what she was up to 30 years before she began slaying via videotape.
RamRao	testing	Carrie White	Compared to ████████████ in the 1976 film "Carrie," Sadako is far nastier, and just like in that earlier film, all heck breaks loose following an instigated public freakout.
RamRao	testing	Sadako	"Ringu 0" is a fairly slow-moving film, and a surprise revelation concerning ██████ that comes halfway through is very hard to swallow.
RamRao	testing	Sadako Yamamura	Shortly after an oddly quiet young woman, ███████████████ (Yukie Nakama), joins a drama troupe, strange events, including deaths with suspicious circumstances, start occurring.
RamRao	testing	Sadako	Is ██████ somehow connected to these events?
RamRao	testing	Sadako	The horror stuff generally works, although ██████ would have benefited from not having so many functions.
RamRao	testing	Hiroshi Takahashi	 The script, by █████████████████, from a story by Ring novelist Koji Suzuki, is admirable on an artistic level.
RamRao	testing	Norio Tsuruta	 The problem is that director █████████████ just cannot get much momentum going with the material.
RamRao	testing	Sadako	There are glimpses, through ██████ or around her, of a more intriguing world, but they're often little more than "flashes" that might cause us to do a double take.
RamRao	testing	Tsuruta	Takahashi and ███████ work hard to establish a romance subplot involving a love triangle (or two), but this can barely get off the ground.
